A website for selling acrylic photos in the Chinese market
Face-mounted photos are literally a non-existent market in China and the product seems to have endless potential being that Chinese people take billions of photos daily.  They need an outlet for these photos and I believe selling them inexpensive face-mounted acrylic prints is one way to enter this market.
The web app is the initial portal for ordering these prints and later a mobile app will be available for quicker and easier ordering of prints so that consumers can upload, customize, and order their prints directly from their mobile device.
